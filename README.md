Autosplitter for Sonic CD with full support for both Steam release and decompilations

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SonicSpeedrunning/LiveSplit.SonicCD2011_wasm/main/settings.png">

# General behaviour

Supports both the Steam version of Sonic CD (2011) and decompilations (available at https://github.com/Rubberduckycooly/Sonic-CD-11-Decompilation).
Everything based on the decompilation above should also be automatically supported, eg. Sonic CD Restored.

Timer is grabbed by the game's memory, with the option to switch to RTA-TB (Time Bonus) if needed, eg during All Time Stones speedruns.

Splits upon loading a new stage according to the order required for a normal run - Present/Past/Future acts are all supported.

Splits can be configured in settings

Timer automatically starts when confirming the character selection at the start of a run.
